This access was subject to the following license agreement on the aforementioned date:

# Streamline Premium Licenses

When you subscribe to our Premium plans, you receive a royalty-free license to use our vector assets in unlimited projects without crediting us. Depending on your plan, you can access premium features for icons, illustrations, elements, emojis, or all asset types if you subscribe to the Full Access plan. The premium license applies to three types of products: 
 
• Full Access plan
• Icons plan
• Illustrations plan
 
This is a legal agreement between you (the Customer) and Streamline Design Inc. (the Licensor), which created Streamline assets for personal and commercial use. Purchasing the assets constitutes acceptance of this agreement.
 
## 1. Permitted Uses: 

 • Use Streamline assets in unlimited commercial or personal projects.
 • Use up to 50 illustrations, 50 elements, 50 emojis, or 100 icons per project.
 • Use in any project type: websites, applications, logos, etc.
    Note: Projects could be templates, website design, application design… even logos! 
              For example, you can include 100 icons in a pitch deck, and 100 different icons in 
              a marketing website. It’s 100 unique icons per project, so if you repeat one icon 10 
              times, it still counts only as one.
 • Use for yourself or on behalf of clients, with the same limits per project.
 • Use templates within your organization. You are allowed to use our icons in non-
   commercial templates, with a limit of 100 icons and 50 illustrations. 
    Commercial template resale requires an [extended license](https://intercom.help/streamlinehq/en/articles/6749992-licenses-for-templates). 
 
## 2. License Limitations: 

 • Do not exceed 100 icons, 50 illustrations, 50 elements, or 50 emojis per project.
 • Only one licensed user per organization can access and use vector sources. 
    Additional licenses can be purchased with a discount for team members.
 • Non-licensed users (developers/designers) can use a prepared selection of 
    icons/illustrations within limits.
 • Weekly download limit: 1,000 assets.
 • [Fair Use Policy](https://help.streamlinehq.com/en/articles/5354366-streamline-premium-licenses) applies to prevent subscription abuse.
 
 
## 3. Customer Rights: 

• Use assets in projects perpetually without renewal fees.
   ​Note: The lifetime license applies only to the assets you've embedded or used in your 
              projects, not to the ones you've downloaded. To continue using them, 
              maintaining your subscription would be necessary.
 • Use assets globally.
 • Modify assets in shape, size, color, and format.
 • Embed up to 100 icons, 50 illustrations, 50 elements, or 50 emojis per project.
   • Include assets in templates for internal use or work intended for third parties, within 
     the stated limits.
 • Use in open-source projects with proper attribution and limits. Remember that 
    attribution is mandatory when incorporating our icons into open-source projects, 
    including proper credits and a link to [https://streamlinehq.com](https://streamlinehq.com).
 • Incorporate assets into logos or trademarks.
 • Animate assets with limits and no resale.
 • Use assets on physical items for resale if they are part of a unique design.
 • Transfer the license to a new owner.
 
## 4. Prohibited Uses: 

 • Do not sell or redistribute assets.
 • Do not include assets in commercial templates for resale without an extended license.
 • Do not modify assets to resell them in an unrecognizable form.
 • Do not use assets for AI training.
